# Copy this file to config.toml and adjust paths as needed

# Directory paths (relative to project root or absolute)
# Default: ../Input, ../Reference, ../Output, ../Archive

[processing]
# Attendee count estimation range
# Default: Random between 2-8 attendees per transaction

max_attendees = 8

# Primary ID selection weights (must sum to 1.0)
# Default: 90% probability for ID '2', 10% for ID '1'
# The primary ID is selected first, then remaining slots filled randomly

# Alternative: Equal weights for IDs '1' and '2'

# Alternative: Prefer ID '1' over ID '2'
