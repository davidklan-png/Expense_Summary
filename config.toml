# Controls how attendee counts are determined: by transaction amount or random

# ENABLE/DISABLE: Set enabled = true to use amount-based logic, false for random
# When enabled: attendee counts determined by transaction amount using brackets below
# When disabled: random selection between min_attendees and max_attendees
