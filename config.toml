# Attendee count estimation range
# Default: Random between 2-8 attendees per transaction

# Primary ID selection weights (must sum to 1.0)
# Default: 90% probability for ID '2', 10% for ID '1'
# The primary ID is selected first, then remaining slots filled randomly
[processing.primary_id_weights]
"2" = 0.9  # 90% chance

# Alternative: Equal weights for IDs '1' and '2'

# Amount-based attendee estimation (optional)
# If this section is present, attendee counts are determined by transaction amount
# Each bracket defines an amount range and corresponding attendee count range
# Format: "min_amount-max_amount" = { min = X, max = Y }
# Amounts are in yen. Use 999999999 for "unlimited" upper bound.

# Fallback: if no bracket matches, calculate as amount / cost_per_person (minimum 2)
cost_per_person = 3000  # ¥3,000 per person average

# Amount brackets (randomly select between min and max attendees)
