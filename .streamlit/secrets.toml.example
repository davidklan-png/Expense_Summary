# Streamlit Secrets Configuration Template
# Copy this file to secrets.toml and fill in your values
# DO NOT commit secrets.toml to git!

# Example: If you need API keys or database credentials
# [database]
# host = "your-database-host"
# user = "your-username"
# password = "your-password"

# For this app, you may not need secrets unless you add authentication
# or external API integrations in the future
