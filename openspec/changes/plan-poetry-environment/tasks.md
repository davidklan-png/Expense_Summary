# Tasks
- [x] Phase1-1: Review `docs/spec.txt` and current repo layout for references to Input/Reference/Output expectations.
- [x] Phase1-2: Draft the environment requirements (Poetry usage, deps, virtualenv location, templates directory).
- [x] Phase1-3: Document the `config.toml` schema and relative path resolution for external folders.
- [x] Phase1-4: Validate the planning artifacts with `openspec validate plan-poetry-environment --strict` (no implementation yet) and address any issues. DoD evidence: attach the validation output summary in `evidence.md`.
- [x] Phase1-5: Update `evidence.md` with references (diffs, command logs) proving the previous Phase1 tasks are complete.
